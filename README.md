# Digit Recognition Project using MNIST Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for a digit recognition project using the MNIST dataset. The project aims to train a machine learning model to accurately identify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshul82001/Digit_recognition.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

   - NumPy
   - TensorFlow
   - Matplotlib

   You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
   ```
## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the test set.

The evaluation script will load the test data, preprocess it, and evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.
